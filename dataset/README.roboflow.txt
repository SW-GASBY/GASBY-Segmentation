The dataset includes 1566 images.
Basketball-court are annotated in COCO for MMDetection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -11 and +11 degrees
* Random shear of between -13째 to +13째 horizontally and -14째 to +14째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.6 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.88 percent of pixels
